#### Git: branches

*Note*: you will need permission from the rubycorns in order to push your branches to this repository.

and create a branch from your fork.

Create new branch (you should be in the directory of the project)

Switch to the newly created branch (the same if you need to change to the branch that already exist)

Or do both steps at the same time:

    git checkout -b Name_of_your_branch

Push the new branch to the repository (with some commits or just "bare" branch)

    git push --set-upstream origin Name_of_your_branch

Delete local branch

    git branch -D Name_of_your_branch


#### Git: commit your changes

Make changes, then

    git add -A

Tell the others what you did

    git commit -m "description of changes"

Off to GitHub
